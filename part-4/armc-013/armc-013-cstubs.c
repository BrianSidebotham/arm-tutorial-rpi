    Graceful failure is permitted by returning an error code. A minor
    complication arises here: the C library must be compatible with development
    environments that supply fully functional versions of these subroutines.
    Such environments usually return error codes in a global errno. However,
    the Red Hat newlib C library provides a macro definition for errno in the
    header file errno.h, as part of its support for reentrant routines (see
    Reentrancy).

    The bridge between these two interpretations of errno is straightforward:
    the C library routines with OS interface calls capture the errno values
    returned globally, and record them in the appropriate field of the
    reentrancy structure (so that you can query them using the errno macro from
    errno.h).

    This mechanism becomes visible when you write stub routines for OS
    interfaces. You must include errno.h, then disable the macro, like this:
*/
#include <errno.h>
#undef errno
extern int errno;

/* Required include for fstat() */
#include <sys/stat.h>

/* Required include for times() */
#include <sys/times.h>

/* A pointer to a list of environment variables and their values. For a minimal
   environment, this empty list is adequate: */
char *__env[1] = {0};
char **environ = __env;

/* A helper function written in assembler to aid us in allocating memory */
extern caddr_t _get_stack_pointer(void);


/* Never return from _exit as there's no OS to exit to, so instead we trap
   here */
void _exit( int status )
{
    /* Stop the compiler complaining about unused variables by "using" it */
