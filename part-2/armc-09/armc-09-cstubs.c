    Graceful failure is permitted by returning an error code. A minor
    complication arises here: the C library must be compatible with development
    environments that supply fully functional versions of these subroutines.
    Such environments usually return error codes in a global errno. However,
    the Red Hat newlib C library provides a macro definition for errno in the
    header file errno.h, as part of its support for reentrant routines (see
    Reentrancy).

    The bridge between these two interpretations of errno is straightforward:
    the C library routines with OS interface calls capture the errno values
    returned globally, and record them in the appropriate field of the
    reentrancy structure (so that you can query them using the errno macro from
    errno.h).

    This mechanism becomes visible when you write stub routines for OS
    interfaces. You must include errno.h, then disable the macro, like this:

#include <sys/stat.h>


/* Increase program data space. As malloc and related functions depend on this,
   it is useful to have a working implementation. The following suffices for a
   standalone system; it exploits the symbol _end automatically defined by the
   GNU linker. */
caddr_t _sbrk( int incr )
{
    extern char _end;
    static char* heap_end = 0;
    char* prev_heap_end;

    if( heap_end == 0 )
        heap_end = &_end;

     prev_heap_end = heap_end;

     heap_end += incr;
     return (caddr_t)prev_heap_end;
}
