/** @brief Max interrupts that the GIC supports

    Indicates the maximum number of interrupts that the GIC supports. If ITLinesNumber=N, the
    maximum number of interrupts is 32(N+1). The interrupt ID range is from 0 to
    (number of IDs â€“ 1). For example: 0b00011

    Up to 128 interrupt lines, interrupt IDs 0-127.

    The maximum number of interrupts is 1020 ( 0b11111 ). See the text in this section for more
    information.

    Regardless of the range of interrupt IDs defined by this field, interrupt IDs 1020-1023 are
    reserved for special purposes, see Special interrupt numbers on page 3-43 and Interrupt IDs
    on page 2-24.
