# Part 5 - Graphics (Basic)

Finally, we get on to a tutorial that moves us away from blinking an LED as we explore the
VideoCore IV GPU

> **NOTE:** This tutorial has not yet been migrated to **RPI4**!

## Reference Material

We need some reading material for this tutorial - this is how I put the tutorial together, by
reading and studying the manuals available for the Videcore, but for this tutorial mainly the
information from the Cambridge Raspberry Pi Tutorials. Yes there's a lot of text and more than
one manual - but that's the only way you learn!

Some material that's useful (Generally for late night reading!):

- [Raspberry Pi Firmware Mailboxes information](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/wiki/Accessing-mailboxes)

This information is less important for now, but worth noting:

- [VideoCoreIv-AG100 3D Architecture Reference](http://www.broadcom.com/docs/support/videocore/VideoCoreIV-AG100-R.pdf)
- [Android Graphics Driver Source Code for VideoCoreIV](http://www.broadcom.com/docs/support/videocore/Brcm_Android_ICS_Graphics_Stack.tar.gz)

## The GPU (Videocore IV)

The GPU and ARM devices can communicate with each other through a mailbox system. However, don't
forget that the ARM and GPU also share the memory space, and so although we have to communicate
through the mailbox, this is what negotiates settings and a framebuffer. The framebuffer address
in memory is then returned from the GPU and we can go ahead and write to the framebuffer to see
graphics.

A framebuffer is a term that really refers to a block of video memory. This video memory is used
to display pixels on the screen. So we have access to each pixel on the screen and can change
it's colour properties. The framebuffer should be at least as big as the screen resolution. The
size of the framebuffer memory block is given by:

```c
framebuffer_bytes = pixels_x * pixels_y * bytes_per_pixel
```

> **NOTE** In this tutorial we'll be using a framebuffer and so won't have any higher-level
> functions like OpenGL or accelerated graphics. We're going to create a simple software renderer.

The number of bytes per pixel sets the number of colours available. The Raspberry-Pi GPU supports
8-bit, but in this mode the 8-bit value corresponds to a palette entry, and the palette appears
to be very limited A palette mode can be really useful as it's fast (minimal amount of memory
required for the graphics) and can be really useful for some special effects by simply altering
the palette.

16-bit requires two bytes of data per pixel and directly represents the Red, Green and Blue
levels of the colour of the pixel, and 32-bit has 4 bytes of data per pixel which has 8-bit per
primary colour and an 8-biot alpha channel (transparency).

The GPU is generally quite a closely guarded secret. It's a specialised processor, but also a
powerful processor and most people would like to run code on it, just like we're running code
on the GPU itself, but alas the GPU information is still under NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)
terms.

Broadcom however, did release some information and some of the most interesting information is
in the [BCM21553 Graphics Driver](http://www.broadcom.com/docs/support/videocore/Brcm_Android_ICS_Graphics_Stack.tar.gz)
. I'll reference what material I've got from there as we go. Unfortunately there is no definitive
source of information for the Raspberry Pi GPU, only bits and pieces scattered around the web.

The GPU is a Videocore IV. As we're going to use the mailbox communication with the GPU anyway,
we can skip a lot of the GPU detail and just concentrate on communicating with the GPU to get a
framebuffer to use.

The mailbox interface is our main entry point into the world of graphics. The interface was
developed and created by a few guys at broadcom. The mailbox interface is software running on
the GPU which receives messages from software running on the arm and returns responses to each
message after performing a task. It's implemented in the start.elf file that we require on the
SD Card to boot the Raspberry-Pi. You can see their discussion about implementing the mailbox
on [Github](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/47)

The mailboxes are defined [on Github](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/wiki/Mailboxes).

The interface we're interested in is the
[Property Interface Mailbox](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/wiki/Mailbox-property-interface)

This mailbox is responsible for negotiating the framebuffer. We need some code to be able to
read and write data from the mailbox and we also need to define the data structure defined by
the framebuffer mailbox documentation.

## part-5/armc-014

The ARM014 tutorial introduces a few new peices of the puzzle. Firstly, as an aid to debugging
now the code is getting more complex it introduces the mini UART which means we can have a basic
"console". As we've bothered with the standard c library we can see how to tie the standard
library functions like `printf()` to the UART. Secondly, it introduces the mailbox property
interface which is a method of the ARM processor talking to the GPU. If we're going to get to
the point of generating graphics, we must talk to the GPU!

This code does generate an "animated" display, but as we'll see - it is extremely slow to
use un-optimised software rendering on an RPI! If you want, go ahead and compile it now and
plug the raspberry pi into a monitor or television with a HDMI interface. It **should** work!
As we're now including new hardware into the mix it's possible that your monitor or TV doesn't
support the resolution and colour depth that the example is hard coded to use. It's an example
that's designed to be simple rather than supporting every HDMI panel out there. Hopefully
you'll have luck with it. I'm using an old Hanns-G HUD19 monitor with DVI->HDMI adaptor.

If it works, you'll see an ever-changing display which moves through the colour spectrum,
continuously writing to every pixel in the framebuffer! You can see the (rather boring) output
on [YouTube](https://youtube.com).

This tutorial shows how a 700MHz (or 900MHz) processor doesn't give you carte-blanche to
program in C and end up with an optimised output. In this example there is no vertical sync
used, we simply dedicate 100% of the ARM processor time to drawing the rectangle in video
memory and then moving it one pixel before drawing it to the video memory again. In this way
we can see the raw speed of the processor at work. It's pretty slow isn't it!

We'll optimise in the ARM015 code later on in this tutorial.

## Getting a UART Text Console

Read that title carefully, not getting a graphics Text Console but instead getting some text
out of the code to help us debug. As the code becomes more complex we need better ways of
debugging. A later tutorial will talk about using JTAG but for now we can have the basic UART
based text debugging that gets us out of most holes!

This requires some hardware. Namely a
[TTL-232R-3V3](http://cpc.farnell.com/ftdi/ttl-232r-3v3/cable-usb-to-ttl-level-seri-converter/dp/SC10142)
or equivalent is required. The mini uart described in the AUX peripheral below is available on
the RPI IO expansion headers on pins 8 (GPIO14/TXD) and 10 (GPIO15/RXD)

Connecting the UART to a PC is pretty easy, a quick connection guide is available:

![UART Connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianSidebotham/arm-tutorial-rpi/master/part-5/images/ftdi-ttl-232r-3v3-rpi-connection.png)

Also, a quick photo of one connected up:

![UART Connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianSidebotham/arm-tutorial-rpi/master/part-5/images/ftdi-ttl-232r-3v3-rpi-connection-photo.jpg)

### AUX peripheral

The AUX peripheral includes a couple of communication interfaces which we can put to use. In
this tutorial we will enable the mini UART which has Rx/Tx signals available on the IO header
of the raspberry-pi. We will connect that to an FTDI 3.3V USB->UART converter and then we can
connect PuTTY to the COM port and see output from the code!

We will do some more work on the c stubs to provide uart support in the write system call which
is what the likes of `printf()`, etc. functions use to write to the system.

```c
#include "rpi-aux.h"
#include "rpi-base.h"

    auxillary->MU_BAUD = ( SYS_FREQ / ( 8 * baud ) ) - 1;

     /* Setup GPIO 14 and 15 as alternative function 5 which is

    RPI_SetGpioPinFunction( RPI_GPIO14, FS_ALT5 );
    RPI_SetGpioPinFunction( RPI_GPIO15, FS_ALT5 );

    RPI_GetGpio()->GPPUD = 0;

    RPI_GetGpio()->GPPUDCLK0 = 0;

    /* Disable flow control,enable transmitter and receiver! */
    auxillary->MU_CNTL = AUX_MUCNTL_TX_ENABLE;
}


void RPI_AuxMiniUartWrite( char c )
{
    /* Wait until the UART has an empty space in the FIFO */
    while( ( auxillary->MU_LSR & AUX_MULSR_TX_EMPTY ) == 0 ) { }

    /* Write the character to the FIFO for transmission */
    auxillary->MU_IO = c;
}

I'm not going to go too far into explaining these drivers now. It's written in C, and you've
got the BCM2835 data sheet the same as I have. You should be getting familiar with the layout
of these "driver" files and the documentation in the BCM2835 peripherals document.

We provide an initialisation function so we can set the number of bits (data bits) and the
baud rate. The mini UART implementation isn't that configurable because it's not a full UART
implementation. It's designed to provide a quick means of providing a console with as little
code as possible. So there's no setting for parity or number of stop bits. It's always N1
(No parity, one stop bit).

> **HACK:** The calculation for the baud rate registers is done based on a defined system
> frequency of 250MHz. It works, but it's not as nice as using a detected system frequency.

The functions are written in a blocking mode, so the write function blocks until the UART can
accept the next character, then it writes the new character and returns. Normally we'd use the
UART interrupt to send a whole buffer of data rather than manually polling the register as this
ties the processor up waiting. However, these are easy to use!

### The _write() System Call

Whenever data needs to be written to the OS it's done so through a function called `_write`.
This is one of the original c-stubs we wrote in a previous tutorial. We previously just
implemented a blank function. Here's the blank function we had. As you can see, it's not quite
blank, but `outbyte` does nothing with the data, it's an empty sink.

```c
void outbyte( char b )
{
    (void)b;
}

int _write( int file, char *ptr, int len )
{
    int todo;

    for( todo = 0; todo < len; todo++ )
      outbyte(*ptr++);

    return len;
}
```

We can tie all writes to the OS (for all files) to the UART console by adding the UART write
function call to outbyte:

```c
void outbyte( char b )
{
    RPI_AuxMiniUartWrite( b );
}
```

Originally this is what I did, and then when I used printf() to test function I kept getting
a crash. In fact after some debugging with the OK LED in the processor exception handlers we
introduced in the last tutorial I was able to determine it was an undefined instruction error.

When you run this tutorials examples with PuTTY, you'll see output similar to this:

![PuTTY RPi Connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianSidebotham/arm-tutorial-rpi/master/part-5/images/putty-rpi-connection.png)

### Enabling VFP Support

After a bit more thinking and tinkering I realised we have to enable the VFP now in order to
use printf. As we're compiling and telling the compiler (or more the linker actually) that we're
targeting a device with the VFP it is linking to a libc that can use VFP instructions and why
shouldn't something in the printf implementation use the VFP instruction when necessary to
speed things up?

There is some [more information about the problem on a stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24589235/application-hangs-when-calling-printf-to-uart-with-bare-metal-raspberry-pi/27257841#27257841).

Without the VFP co-processor being enabled, VFP instructions will cause an undefined instruction
exception. Enabling the VFP is another task that the C Runtime startup file crt0 would have
performed for us, but we're on our own since we have to use `-nostartfiles` (See an earlier
tutorial).

Some [recommended information about enabling VFP support](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dai0098a/index.html)
is available from ARM.

Some [example code for enabling the VFP](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Cortex-A8#How_to_enable_NEON)
is available on the TI wiki, and that's the code we slice in to armc-start.S so that the VFP
is enabled before the c library is setup:

```asm
// Enable VFP ------------------------------------------------------------

// r1 = Access Control Register
MRC p15, #0, r1, c1, c0, #2
// enable full access for p10,11
ORR r1, r1, #(0xf << 20)
// ccess Control Register = r1
MCR p15, #0, r1, c1, c0, #2
MOV r1, #0
// flush prefetch buffer because of FMXR below
MCR p15, #0, r1, c7, c5, #4
// and CP 10 & 11 were only just enabled
// Enable VFP itself
MOV r0,#0x40000000
// FPEXC = r0
FMXR FPEXC, r0
```

With those additions, we can now go ahead and use the c-library write functions. It means that
the full `printf()` implementation can be used on the UART for example without us having to lift
a finger and try and implement something as fundamental as that ourselves.

Also, this provides us with a debug/comms channel that is separate to the display. It's hard to
use the display for debugging when the display isn't yet working!

## Mailboxes

We introduce some code in a few files, namely `rpi-mailbox` and `rpi-mailbox-interface`. The
first is a common interface to access the mailbox system which passes information from the GPU
to the ARM processor. The mailbox interface is implemented in the firmware (start.elf) that
runs on the GPU.

Here's the code, and as noted in the comments, the mailbox interface is described on the RPI
firmware github wiki:

/* Mailbox 0 mapped to it's base address */
static mailbox_t* rpiMailbox0 = (mailbox_t*)RPI_MAILBOX0_BASE;

void RPI_Mailbox0Write( mailbox0_channel_t channel, int value )
{
    /* For information about accessing mailboxes, see:
       https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/wiki/Accessing-mailboxes */

    /* Add the channel number into the lower 4 bits */
    value &= ~(0xF);
    value |= channel;

    /* Wait until the mailbox becomes available and then write to the mailbox
       channel */
    while( ( rpiMailbox0->Status & ARM_MS_FULL ) != 0 ) { }

    /* Write the modified value + channel number into the write register */
    rpiMailbox0->Write = value;
}


int RPI_Mailbox0Read( mailbox0_channel_t channel )
{
    /* For information about accessing mailboxes, see:
       https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/wiki/Accessing-mailboxes */
    int value = -1;

    /* Keep reading the register until the desired channel gives us a value */
    while( ( value & 0xF ) != channel )
    {
        /* Wait while the mailbox is empty because otherwise there's no value
           to read! */
        while( rpiMailbox0->Status & ARM_MS_EMPTY ) { }

        /* Extract the value from the Read register of the mailbox. The value
           is actually in the upper 28 bits */
        value = rpiMailbox0->Read;
    }

    /* Return just the value (the upper 28-bits) */
    return value >> 4;
}
```

There are two mailboxes, 0 and 1. We only need to use mailbox 0. Mailbox has a number of
channels to communicate on which are defined in the `enum mailbox0_channel_t`.

The basics of the mailbox operation are pretty straight forward.

To **write** to a mailbox we first construct a composite value. We can write a 32-bit value
to the GPU which is generally a memory address, but the mailbox also has to support multiple
channels and there is no separate place to write the channel number. In order to achieve
multiple channels on a single mailbox the lower nibble (4-bits) are reserved for the channel
number and the upper 28-bits are the value we're sending to the GPU. This means that any
address we send to the GPU is missing the lowest 4-bits and the GPU simply assumes those bits
are all 0. We therefore need to align any address we send the GPU to a 16-byte boundary which
will ensure the lower 4-bits will be 0.

The ARM waits for the mailbox to become empty by polling the status register and then it can
write the composite value of the address and channel to the mailbox.

To **read** from a mailbox we wait until the mailbox is full and read the value. Only when
the value contains the same channel as we are waiting to communicate with do we proceed and
return.

The value is a 16-byte aligned memory address. It's important to know that we don't just send
a value and get a value back. We send an address to a memory block that we have constructed
specifically formatted messages in to communicate with the GPU. The messages that are passed
to the GPU are channel dependant and so aren't defined in this code module. We will do a code
module for each channel we use. Actually, we're only going to use one - `MB0_TAGS_ARM_TO_VC` which
is used with the mailbox property interface.

> **NOTE:** Although the Framebuffer channel looks like the place to begin, actually we'll
> ignore that mailbox channel because it's a deprecated channel. It came before the mailbox
> property interface channel had framebuffer properties added to it.

### Mailbox Property Interface

The [Mailbox Property Interface](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/wiki/Mailbox-property-interface)
specifies the messaging structure that needs to be present in the 16-byte aligned memory region
I mentioned earlier. There are a lot of properties, and you need to read that page a couple of
times to get a hold of how the data needs to be laid out.

Here's the code we're using to support the Mailbox Property Interface:

```c
#include <stdarg.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "rpi-mailbox.h"
#include "rpi-mailbox-interface.h"

/* Make sure the property tag buffer is aligned to a 16-byte boundary because
   we only have 28-bits available in the property interface protocol to pass
   the address of the buffer to the VC. */
static int pt[8192] __attribute__((aligned(16)));
static int pt_index = 0;


void RPI_PropertyInit( void )

We start off with a memory buffer which is large enough to hold a concatenated list of property
tags and data for the property tags we want to use. We use a gcc extension to align it to
a 16-byte boundary:

```c
static int pt[8192] __attribute__((aligned(16)));
```

The rest of the functions form a C API to the Mailbox Property Interface. There are various
APIs people come up with to generate the memory structure.

The messages are constructed such that the data length is large enough for whichever is larger,
the message request data size or the response data size. It's also good to note that so long as
the data size is large enough the GPU will be happy. i.e. you can use a larger data size for the
tag and the GPU won't complain. As you can see from the
`void RPI_PropertyAddTag( rpi_mailbox_tag_t tag, ... )` switch `tag` statement there are only a
few types of tag layout anyway.

The GPU acts upon tag values which have the request/response code set to process request
settings (always 0). When the GPU has parsed a value and filled the tag's value buffer with the
value required it sets the request/response indicator to 1 to show that the data in the value
buffer is the GPU's response. All of this modifies the data in-place.

The API I wrote for this tutorial allows us to have a simple paradime for using the property
interface.

```c
/* Initialise, Add and Process tags */
RPI_PropertyInit();
RPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_*, ... );
RPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_*, ... );
RPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_*, ... );
RPI_PropertyProcess();

/* Get the value for each tag */
property_value_buffer = RPI_PropertyGet( TAG_* );
```

## The Framebuffer Properties

If you don't yet know, a framebuffer is a block of memory who's data is written to a display.
The data organisation depends on the display's attributes such as width, height, colour depth,
etc. There is not usually a conversion between one type of data and the framebuffer. The GPU
simply clocks the data in the framebuffer to the display.

If a monitor is plugged in to the Raspberry-Pi the GPU detects it and displays a colour gradiant
square on the screen. This shows that the RPI is up and running and has detected the screen.

Through the mailbox property interface we can negotiate with the GPU so that it creates a
framebuffer in memory that is of the correct size to represent the screen attached (or the size
of the virtual screen we've requested). It will return a pointer to that memory so that the ARM
has memory it can write to that will be directly written to the screen by the GPU. It's the
most basic and simplest form of graphics. Each pixel's colour can be controlled by writing
data into the buffer.

Let's look at how we use the property interface to negotiate a 32-bit framebuffer at 1280x1024:

```c
/* Initialise a framebuffer... */
RPI_PropertyInit();
RPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_ALLOCATE_BUFFER );
RPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_SET_PHYSICAL_SIZE, 1280, 1024 );
RPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_SET_VIRTUAL_SIZE, 1280, 2048 );
RPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_SET_DEPTH, 32 );
RPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_GET_PITCH );
RPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_GET_PHYSICAL_SIZE );
RPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_GET_DEPTH );
RPI_PropertyProcess();
```

As you can see, we set up a load of tags for the GPU to process. We ask it to allocate a
framebuffer, so set the physical and virtual size of the screen, and the colour depth. We then
also ask it to return us some information, the current pitch, the physical size and the colour
depth.

The mailbox interface guarantees that the SET_\* tags will be completed before the GET_\* tags are
processed so we can do a single process with all of the tags in place. Some of the SET_\* tags may
not be able to achieve what we ask for and so we must use the GET_\* tags to know what the
framebuffer settings actually are.

The reason there is a physical and virtual size (and why they are set differently!) is because
the virtual size can be larger than the physical size where the physical is "mapped" to a part
of the framebuffer. The framebuffer is made to hold the largest of the two (which is invariably
the virtual size).

In the code I've made the virtual size twice the height of the physical size. There are other
mailbox properties that allow us to set an offset where the physical screen will begin in the
framebuffer. You can think of the virtual as being the framebuffer and the physical as the
screen. We can draw to a larger framebuffer in a region that's off the physical screen and then
offset the physical screen to the area of the framebuffer we've drawn to and the update to the
screen is instant rather than updating as we draw which usually shows artifacts.

For now, we just initialise the framebuffer (using the code above) and then write to the
framebuffer space within the limits of the physical size. We draw a colour gradient box like
the GPU does on power-on, but we "animate" it by continuously altering the colour vectors and
re-drawing the screen. We use 100% of the CPU processing time to draw and you'll see just how
slow this is!

Go ahead and run the example. You can spend some time changing the colour depth setting and
screen size to see the performance of the framebuffer fill. You'll notice it's a lot slower
than you'd realise to refresh the screen when every pixel is written to.

This is the code that does the actual draw to the framebuffer:

```c
pixel_offset = ( x * ( bpp >> 3 ) ) + ( y * pitch );

r = (int)( current_colour.r * 0xFF ) & 0xFF;
g = (int)( current_colour.g * 0xFF ) & 0xFF;
b = (int)( current_colour.b * 0xFF ) & 0xFF;
a = (int)( current_colour.b * 0xFF ) & 0xFF;

if( bpp == 32 )
{
    /* Four bytes to write */
    fb[ pixel_offset++ ] = r;
    fb[ pixel_offset++ ] = g;
    fb[ pixel_offset++ ] = b;
    fb[ pixel_offset++ ] = a;
}
else if( bpp == 24 )
{
    /* Three bytes to write */
    fb[ pixel_offset++ ] = r;
    fb[ pixel_offset++ ] = g;
    fb[ pixel_offset++ ] = b;
}
else if( bpp == 16 )
{
    /* Two bytes to write */
    /* Bit pack RGB565 into the 16-bit pixel offset */
    *(unsigned short*)&fb[pixel_offset] = ( (r >> 3) << 11 ) | ( ( g >> 2 ) << 5 ) | ( b >> 3 );
}
else
{
    /* Palette mode. TODO: Work out a colour scheme for
    packing rgb into an 8-bit palette! */
}
```

As you can see, for each colour depth there is a different drawing algorithm. The RPI also
supports an 8-bit palette mode which is not supported here.

The pixel offset calculation can be done based on the bpp (bits-per-pixel) or colour depth
setting. Notice that normally we'd use the screen width in this calculation, but instead we're
using `pitch`. This is because the GPU can optimse the number of bytes per pixel line so that
it can do faster maths, so this is one of the values we request back from the GPU when we
initialise the framebuffer.

The framebuffer memory is organised with the top left pixel being at offset 0, in screen
coordinates this is 0,0.

> **NOTE:** To notice any animation of the colour with this example, you may have to run the
> sample code for a little while.

### armc-014

This example expands on the previous pt4 interrupts code and introduces the mailbox API to
negotiate a framebuffer with the GPU. It then draws an ever-changing colour square on the screen
which changes colour to animate the display. The Frames Per Second (FPS) is also calculated and
sent to the mini UART so if you're monitoring the UART with a terminal such as PuTTY you'll be
able to see the FPS calculated live on your Pi.

While we acheive that, this does demonstrate how slow software rendering is. The framebuffer is
set to 640x480 so that the demo will work on every HDMI panel that's plugged in. 640x480 is not
exactly a big screen and yet below are the Frames Per Second (FPS) we managed to achieve on the
RPI1 and RPI2.

| RPI1 | RPI2
| --- | ---
| 3.67 | 0.68

Those results are the right way round, I promise! It's time for us to do some thinking and
optimising...

### armc-015

In the RPI processor (both RPI1 and RPI2) there is a cache system which is disabled by default
and is designed to speed the processor up by enabling code to be (hopefully) run from the cache.
In this example we add enabling the cache to the `armc-start.S` startup file:

#### Enabling Cache

```asm
.equ    SCTLR_ENABLE_DATA_CACHE         0x4
.equ    SCTLR_ENABLE_BRANCH_PREDICTION  0x800
.equ    SCTLR_ENABLE_INSTRUCTION_CACHE  0x1000

// Enable L1 Cache -------------------------------------------------------

// R0 = System Control Register
mrc p15,0,r0,c1,c0,0

// Enable caches and branch prediction
orr r0,#SCTLR_ENABLE_BRANCH_PREDICTION
orr r0,#SCTLR_ENABLE_DATA_CACHE
orr r0,#SCTLR_ENABLE_INSTRUCTION_CACHE

// System Control Register = R0
mcr p15,0,r0,c1,c0,0
```

Look to the [ARMv7-a architecture manual](https://silver.arm.com/download/ARM_and_AMBA_Architecture/AR570-DA-70000-r0p0-00rel2/DDI0406C_C_arm_architecture_reference_manual.pdf)
for information on enabling L1 Cache. L1 cache is closest to the processor and so is what we're
interesting in enabling first off.

Let's go through the code we've added so we know **why** we've added it and also why it works.

**Section B6.1.86** SCTLR, System Control Register, PMSA describes the system control register

This register has some bits defined which are useful for us, namely:

```text
I, bit[12] Instruction cache enable bit.

    This is a global enable bit for instruction caches. The possible values
    of this bit are:

    0 Instruction caches disabled.
    1 Instruction caches enabled.

    If the system does not implement any instruction caches that can be
    accessed by the processor, at any level of the memory hierarchy, this
    bit is RAZ/WI.

    If the system implements any instruction caches that can be accessed
    by the processor then it must be possible to disable them by setting
    this bit to 0.

    Cache enabling and disabling on page B2-1270 describes the effect of
    enabling the caches.

Z, bit[11] Branch prediction enable bit.

    The possible values of this bit are:

    0 Program flow prediction disabled.
    1 Program flow prediction enabled.

    Setting this bit to 1 enables branch prediction, also called program
    flow prediction.

    If program flow prediction cannot be disabled, this bit is RAO/WI.
    If the implementation does not support program flow prediction then
    this bit is RAZ/WI.

C, bit[2] Cache enable bit.

    This is a global enable bit for data and unified caches. The possible
    values of this bit are:

    0 Data and unified caches disabled.
    1 Data and unified caches enabled.

    If the system does not implement any data or unified caches that can
    be accessed by the processor, at any level of the memory hierarchy,
    this bit is RAZ/WI.

    If the system implements any data or unified caches that can be
    accessed by the processor then it must be possible to disable them by
    setting this bit to 0.

For more information about the effect of this bit see Cache enabling and
disabling on page B2-1270.

In the [ARMv6 Architecture Manual](https://silver.arm.com/download/ARM_Architecture/AR550-DA-70002-r0p0-00rel0/DDI%2001001.pdf)
for the Pi1 we see:

**Section B3.4** Register 1:Control registers which also descibes the system control register

This control register implements bits in the register we're interested in for enabling L1 cache:

```text
I (bit[12])

    If separate L1 caches are used, this is the enable/disable bit for the L1
    instruction cache:

    0 = L1 instruction cache disabled
    1 = L1 instruction cache enabled.

    If an L1 unified cache is used or the L1 instruction cache is not
    implemented, this bit read as 0 and ignores writes. If the L1 instruction
    cache cannot be disabled, this bit reads as 1 and ignores writes.

    The state of this bit does not affect further levels of cache in the
    system.


Z (bit[11])

    On ARM processors which support branch prediction, this is the
    enable/disable bit for branch prediction:

    0 = Program flow prediction disabled
    1 = Program flow prediction enabled.

    If program flow prediction cannot be disabled, this bit reads as 1 and
    ignores writes.

    Program flow prediction includes all possible forms of speculative change
    of instruction stream prediction. Examples include static prediction,
    dynamic prediction, and return stacks.

    On ARM processors that do not support branch prediction, this bit reads as
    0 and ignores writes.


C (bit[2])

    If a L1 unified cache is used, this is the enable/disable bit for the
    unified cache. If separate L1 caches are used, this is the enable/disable
    bit for the data cache. In either case:

    0 = L1 unified/data cache disabled
    1 = L1 unified/data cache enabled.

    If the L1 cache is not implemented, this bit reads as 0 and ignores
    writes. If the L1 cache cannot be disabled, this bit reads as 1 and
    ignores writes.

    The state of this bit does not affect other levels of cache in the system.
```

As can be seen, although the cache system has changed slightly - it is essentially the same for
us to use across both RPi1 and RPi2:

Get the value of the System Control Register in R0

```asm
// Enable L1 Cache -------------------------------------------------------

// R0 = System Control Register
mrc p15,0,r0,c1,c0,0
```

Enable the three cache bits we just identified in the architecture manuals above:

```asm
// Enable caches and branch prediction
orr r0,#SCTLR_ENABLE_BRANCH_PREDICTION
orr r0,#SCTLR_ENABLE_DATA_CACHE
orr r0,#SCTLR_ENABLE_INSTRUCTION_CACHE
```

Write the modified value back to the System Control Register:

```asm
// System Control Register = R0
mcr p15,0,r0,c1,c0,0
```

#### Maxmising the Clock Speed (RPI2)

I also added in some more mailbox properties to make the RPI2 run faster. When the RPI2 starts
executing code from the ARM the ARM is running at 600MHz which is a way below its 900MHz maximum.
Using the mailbox properties interface we can both ask the GPU for the ARMs maximum frequency
and then set the ARM frequency to the maximum returned by the GPU:

```c
mp = RPI_PropertyGet( TAG_GET_MAX_CLOCK_RATE );

RPI_PropertyInit();
RPI_PropertyAddTag( TAG_SET_CLOCK_RATE, TAG_CLOCK_ARM, mp->data.buffer_32[1] );
RPI_PropertyProcess();
```

Both the above are fairly easy pickings for making sure we're getting the best speed available
out of the processors, yet it was still a bit of work to get the gains!

Run **armc-015** and see the gains! Here's the FPS results:

| RPI1 | RPI2
| --- | ---
| 9.8 | 2.9

Wow! A reasonable gain, but still not exactly fast enough to start writing demos or games
(Other than text-based games!)

#### RPI2 performance

At this point the question of why the RPI2 is so much slower than the RPI1 should come to mind!
I don't have the answer (Send them on a postcard please!)

The only thing going for the RPI1 is a much simpler memory system. Since the RPI2 introduces
a quad-core architecture, things got a whole bunch more complicated on the memory bus.

Anyway, let's see what else we can do.

### Making the Compiler work for us

Up until now we've been working with optimisation levels `-O0`(pre-interrupts) and
`-01`(post-interrupts). The reason for the move to `-01` was to get rid of the caveat that these
tutorials required an earlier version of gcc than the latest that gcc-arm-emedded offered. The
issue was down to [this gcc bug](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=59602) and as
that bug has sat there for at least one minor version, it was time to fix the issue in the code
as opposed to waiting for gcc and gcc-arm-embedded to catch up!

### armc-016

One simple change to this code to see what gains can be had by the compiler. If we're using a C
compiler, we really should take advantage of the fact that a massive part of it's job is to
optimise the code it generates to run as fast as possible.

We'll change the optimisation level, from `-O1` to `-O4`. Nothing else, let's see what happens
to the FPS:

| RPI1 | RPI2
| --- | ---
| 11.2 | 62

That is 62, not 6.2 in the RPI2. Clearly the compiler has done something essential for the RPI2,
and about what I'd expect for the RPI1 target.

What's it done? I don't know, that's for the compiler to know and for me to find out if I can
be bothered. Right now I need get on with writing code.

If you're interested in finding out, you can disassemble the code and see if you can see the
major difference between an `-O1` binary and an `-O4` binary!

I've run out of time, so we'll leave graphics here for now and come back to it in a few
tutorials time to do some more advanced stuff. We'll look at using hardware accelerated
graphics next time.

For now, I think we need to look at JTAG next - I for one am wearing out the SD Card slots on my
RPIs testing and re-testing these tutorials!!
